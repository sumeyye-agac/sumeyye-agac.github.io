### ‚ú® Motivation

Smart glasses are gaining traction across domains like healthcare, education, and industrial training. However, they lack robust, user-friendly methods for personal authentication. Touch-based or alphanumeric methods (e.g., PINs) are often infeasible due to limited or no interface. Linking them to mobile devices is not only inconvenient but also introduces pairing dependencies and security vulnerabilities.

This project addresses a critical gap: **How can we design an intuitive, privacy-preserving, and on-device authentication mechanism for smart glasses that does not rely on external devices or intrusive biometrics?**

We hypothesize that **head movement patterns**, captured via built-in inertial sensors (IMU), can serve as behavioral biometrics unique to individuals. This approach has several advantages:
- **Device-native**: No need for extra hardware or external sensors  
- **Passive and natural**: Users only perform simple, intuitive gestures  
- **Lightweight**: Designed with edge deployment in mind (e.g., minimal features, low compute)

The project advances both **user authentication** and **user identification** on wearable head-mounted displays (HMDs) through gesture-based behavioral modeling - contributing to the broader field of human-centered, privacy-preserving AI.

### üßä Architecture Overview

The system processes motion data from smart glasses to authenticate and identify users based on their head gestures. Data is collected from four onboard sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, rotation vector, geomagnetic), segmented into 1-second windows, and represented using simple statistical features. We frame authentication as a binary classification task and identification as multi-class, evaluating models like Adaboost and Random Forest. With minimal preprocessing and lightweight models, the system achieves up to 99.3% F1-score and 1.3% EER using only two or three sensors, enabling accurate, on-device user recognition.

### üìä Results

We modeled:
- **Authentication** as binary classification (user vs. impostor)  
- **Identification** as multi-class classification (which user is wearing the glasses?)

Using lightweight statistical features (mean, min, max) over 1s windows, we achieved:

| Task              | Best Performance        | Classifier     | Sensors Used              |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Authentication** | 1.3% Equal Error Rate   | Adaboost       | Rotation Vector + GeoMag |
| **Identification** | 99.3% F1-score          | Random Forest  | Acc + RotVec + GeoMag    |
