<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->


I am a machine learning researcher with a PhD in [Computer Engineering](http://cmpe.bogazici.edu.tr/) from [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en), where I was advised by [Prof. Ozlem Durmaz Incel](https://people.utwente.nl/ozlem.durmaz). My doctoral research focused on developing and optimizing efficient deep learning models for human activity recognition using wearable sensor data, such as IMU signals. Through my work, I achieved state-of-the-art performance with lightweight architectures by leveraging knowledge distillation, pruning, quantization and attention mechanisms to create reliable and practical AI solutions for resource-limited devices.

I am passionate about building AI systems that are not just accurate, but truly useful. My work lies at the intersection of research and implementation, with a strong focus on designing machine learning solutions that perform well under real-world constraints. I’m especially drawn to applications in health, fitness, and wellbeing, though I’m equally excited by opportunities where machine learning can make a meaningful impact in people’s lives.
